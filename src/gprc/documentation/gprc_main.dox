 * \section Overview
 *
 * The GP Rule Compiler (gprc) takes in GP2 rules (specified in .gpr files)
 * and produces object files which are typically used in the process of
 * compiling GP programs. They can however be used directly if desired by
 * including the interface header and linking against the object produced.
 *
 * For more information on the GP2 compile process see \ref compiling
