 * \section Overview
 *
 * The GP Program Compiler (gpxc) takes in GP2 programs (specified in .gpx
 * files) and produces object files which can be used to produce either a
 * stand-alone executable version of the program or a shared library which can
 * be integrated into arbitrary C programs.
 *
 * For more information on the GP2 compile process see \ref compiling
